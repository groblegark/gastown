# Platform Versions — Single source of truth for all image builds.
#
# All images (agent, controller, toolchain, gt) are tagged with PLATFORM_VERSION.
# Component versions pin the exact binary that goes into each image.
#
# Format: CalVer YYYY.MM.DD.N where N is the build number for that day.
# Example: 2026.02.16.1 = first build on Feb 16, 2026.
#
# To rebuild images: update versions here, commit, then run:
#   rwx run .rwx/docker.yml --init commit-sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD) --wait
#
# The docker.yml workflow reads this file to pin all binary downloads
# and tags all output images with PLATFORM_VERSION.

PLATFORM_VERSION=2026.02.17.13
